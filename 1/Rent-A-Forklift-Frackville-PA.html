<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Counterbalance forklift trucks are versatile and can be operated both indoors and outdoors. H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years. MARCOM's Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks training has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

<p>This safety switch (which can be a pedal or other special safety harness) will prevent the the lift truck from moving unless activated by the operator.
