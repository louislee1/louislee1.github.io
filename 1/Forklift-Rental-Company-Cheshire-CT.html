<p>Single-reach models extend the length of one pallet and double-reach trucks extend the length of two. If you want to be well equipped to take part in all the off-roading opportunities North Carolina has to offer, buying a lifted truck is the perfect solution. These lifts allow you to add beefier off-road tires and heavier suspension components but do come at a higher cost.</p>

Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>

While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory.
