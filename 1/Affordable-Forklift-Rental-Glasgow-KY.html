Piggyback lifts - They are designed to lock on the back of delivery trucks for easy transportation to work sites as well as the smooth offloading of products. Novice training - This is for those who have no prior knowledge operating forklift trucks. To make sure that this is met even in confined spaces, Linde designed the reach trucks for optimum visibility and fitted them with appropriate equipment.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>
