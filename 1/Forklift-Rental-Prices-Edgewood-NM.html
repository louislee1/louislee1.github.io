We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>We offer our customers access to both Factory New as well as Pre-Owned forklift trucks. At Granite Industrial Trucks we are ready to meet the needs of your company today. Whether you need a compact electric lift truck for your narrow aisles, a big boy 110,000 lb. lift for your quarry operation or anything in between, you can count on Altorfer Cat.

<p>Because they do not require the purchase of fuel, a used electric forklift will be cheaper to use than an internal combustion engine forklift, even though they have an initial higher cost. In June 2018, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling completed its acquisition of 75% shares in Zhejiang Maximal Forklift. Remember, the operator is responsible for the safe operation of the forklift.</p>
<p>In addition our finance department has warranties that can give you peace of mind with your new lifted truck. In most instances, renting a forklift makes more sense than buying one. Whenever a truck is equipped with vertical only, or vertical and horizontal travel controls elevatable with the lifting carriage or forks for lifting personnel, the following additional precautions should be taken for the protection of personnel being elevated.</p>
<p>For the most part, trucks are made with body over frame” construction, which means that there is a basic metal frame for the truck and then the body of the truck is placed onto that frame and attached. As a result, with the adoption of advanced technology, there are substantial market opportunities, owing to the efforts of the manufacturers that are indulged in manufacturing forklift trucks that are technologically driven.</p>
<p>Should the need arise Toyota Material Handling can provide Short Term Rental equipment for peak periods and seasonal requirements. Integral sideshift allows sideways movement of the forks to handle loads that may not be aligned with the truck.
