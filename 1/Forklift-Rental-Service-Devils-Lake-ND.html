Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift trucks have been used since the 1960's to aid in the transportations of heavy warehousing materials over short distances and heights. In addition to being exclusively powered by diesel engines, Class VII forklifts are available in two-wheel and four-wheel drive versions.</p>

<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>Moving Materials: With a rough terrain forklift, moving materials around a job site is easy. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity. Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>

When you are finished with the rental it is a good idea to properly clean the forklift.

We also provide safety training classes that meet OSHA guidelines for forklift operation. With this new generation of straight-mast forklifts, there are plenty of options to choose from. The degree of suspension lift you opt for makes a huge difference while driving on the roads of Conway, Georgetown, and Florence.</p>
