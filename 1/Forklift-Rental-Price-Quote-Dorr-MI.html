Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics.

Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>

In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these. In addition to mapping out a safe route for the pallet jack, the worker should make certain that the equipment will not be overloaded.

<p>But with lift kits, the danger is a little different. Towering over most other folks on the road also provides a greater view into the distance, which is a plus when driving on regular roads and when off-roading. Airide air bag suspension springs are manufactured by Firestone for heavy truck, trailer and bus for applications such as steering axle, seat, cab mount, drive axle, lift axle, and primary trailer air suspension.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
