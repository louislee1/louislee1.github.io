<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area. While it's true that safety officials (OSHA) are more likely to inspect large commercial jobsites than residential or multifamily ones, they will visit any site where incidents have occurred or where complaints have been made. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification. Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive; also available in 2-wheel. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks.

The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
