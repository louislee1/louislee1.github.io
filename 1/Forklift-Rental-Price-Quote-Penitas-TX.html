<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>A 4,000 lbs forklift with a 500 lbs clamp can only add 3,500 more lbs of items. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity. According to U.S. government statistics, forklift-related accidents account for nearly 20,000 injuries and nearly 100 fatalities per year.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>

It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>
