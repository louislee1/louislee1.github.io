In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013.

<h3>The Benefits Of Lifting Truck Budd Lake NJ 07828</h3>
<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate a Counterbalanced Lift Truck. While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>
