<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

OSHA tests you on properly driving forklifts. Product-line features: Each of the JCB rough-terrain forklifts is powered by a four-cylinder diesel engine generating 76 horsepower, driven for quick, smooth operation in all terrain by a JCB SyncroShuttle transmission.</p>
<p>The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design. The good news is you don't need to have any experience of driving a forklift truck to start learning with an accredited training provider. Our entire range of electric order pickers is characterised by extremely robust construction. The new products offer advances in efficiency technology with their optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking.</p>
