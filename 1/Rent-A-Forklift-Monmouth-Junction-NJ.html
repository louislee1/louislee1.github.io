<p>Rough-terrain forklifts with telescopic booms are a unique category offering longer horizontal reach, and some models can swivel a full 360 degrees for improved maneuverability. While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>

<p>Moving Materials: With a rough terrain forklift, moving materials around a job site is easy. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity. Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>

While these two lift kits are somewhat similar, there are important differences between them.

<p>Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
