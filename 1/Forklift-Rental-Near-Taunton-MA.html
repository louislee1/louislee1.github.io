<p>Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles. Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>

<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>Pallet jacks are cheap, small in size, and good for small loads. Purchasing a lifted truck can be somewhat difficult, because these rare vehicles are hard to come by in some locations. They can handle anything from small single pallet loads to 40-foot loaded containers.
