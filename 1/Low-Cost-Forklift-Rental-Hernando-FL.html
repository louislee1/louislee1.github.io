The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck.

The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when load is raised to maximum lift height.

<p>We bring forth our vast industrial experience and expertise in this business, instrumental in providing Forklift Truck. Rough terrain forklifts are used for areas that need the maximum amount of traction to transport inventory safely. To avoid accidents, the operator should always remember to stack the loads evenly across the pallet and that they are balanced. With no mast blocking the view ahead like on conventional forklifts, the Teletruk's unique side boom provides unrivalled forward visibility.</p>
<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.</p>
