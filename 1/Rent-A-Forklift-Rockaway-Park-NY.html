<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA. The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>

<p>The Toyota Forklifts website is owned by the Toyota company, and is the definitive resource for renting quality approved equipment. BlueLine rental team members are encouraged to spend time with their rental customers to learn about their precise needs. It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it. Lifted cars can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more So, if you are going to buy one, it's only fair that you test it out first.</p>

<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
