Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
