<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front.
