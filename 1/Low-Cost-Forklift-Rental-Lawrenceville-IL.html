<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>The Forklift Network has 170 dealers across North America including Canadian Provinces, and has thousands of used electric forklifts for sale. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>
