While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
<p>The cost to rent a narrow aisle forklift is roughly $200 to $300 per day, $400 to $500 per week, and $1,000 to $1,500 per month. These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas.
