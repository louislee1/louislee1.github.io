<p>In addition our finance department has warranties that can give you peace of mind with your new lifted truck. In most instances, renting a forklift makes more sense than buying one. Whenever a truck is equipped with vertical only, or vertical and horizontal travel controls elevatable with the lifting carriage or forks for lifting personnel, the following additional precautions should be taken for the protection of personnel being elevated.</p>

A person must learn how to drive a forklift while carrying a payload.</p>
<p>Heavy Metal Learning is designed to provide educational content on how to operate heavy equipment; a forum for operators and industry supporters to share their knowledge; an opportunity to get out in the field; and ultimately inspiring the next generation. As with any other vehicle, trucks make statements.
