Our industrial reach forklift truck training course will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial reach forklift truck.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>
