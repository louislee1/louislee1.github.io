<p>There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension. The order picker forklift has a small platform big enough for the operator to stand behind the forks with controls for operating the forks.

The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts. If not, our enthusiastic sales team will talk through your requirements, and help you pick out a truck (or fleet of trucks) that is suitable for your requirements, and the requirements of your project.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly.

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
