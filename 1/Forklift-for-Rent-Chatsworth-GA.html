Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

<p>The following particularly applies to pallet trucks with a platform: Many ergonomic elements and functions make it easier to operate the truck. Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts.
