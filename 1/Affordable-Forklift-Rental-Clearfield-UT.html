<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs.

With rental, you know and control your forklift budget in advance and optimise operating costs by adjusting your fleet size to the minimum number of units needed. We are offering Wide Hydraulic Pallet Trucks that are used for material handling and offer ease of handling.</p>

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>It would be a nightmare in New York City, but Nashville's spread out communities are made for vehicles like The Beast, and it fits right in if you drive an hour outside the city. Whether working within the tight quarters of a semi trailer, stacking loads on the dock or handling put-away and retrieval within warehouse racks, the SC Series provides operators with the capability and confidence needed to position loads with precision.</p>
<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts. Push the handle down to pump up the pallet jack, then let the handle come back using the mechanical spring.
