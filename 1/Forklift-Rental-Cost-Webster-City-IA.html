<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding.

<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch.

If you need help choosing a suspension kit for your vehicle, or can't find the kit your looking for, contact one of our mechanics.</p>

Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
