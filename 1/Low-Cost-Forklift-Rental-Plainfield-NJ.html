<p>They have a more powerful engine than other types of forklifts , making them reach higher and faster speeds. These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel.

<p>This is an important distinction because in order to install a lift kit, the truck's body and frame must be separate.
