The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing.

<p>On completion of this conversion training, operators will have an demonstrated a robust understanding of the operational features and techniques associated to 4 way directional reach truck operations.
