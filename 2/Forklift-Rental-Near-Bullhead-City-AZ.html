Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary.
