<p>Sunbelt Rentals offers a variety of forklift equipment for any type of project. So, unless you're asking for a specific type of lift truck by name, you likely want a forklift. Our type of forklift at the Western Illinois University physical plant is a sit down rider type with the forklift that has a counterbalance in the rear. No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these.
