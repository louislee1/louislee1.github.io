Built for the extreme, the WT Series platform pallet truck features a cast-steel reinforced chassis, up to 12 mm thick covers, die-cast aluminum handle and the toughest side restraints available.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts might look like they can only tackle one type of job. These are nice Crown order picker lift trucks with low hours and in good working order. For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic. Because of the high initial cost, almost all forklifts are either rented or financed.</p>
<h2>Cat Lift Truck Eagle</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle.

<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up.
