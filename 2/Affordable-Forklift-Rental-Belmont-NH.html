<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>
<h2>Why Manual Pallet Jack Safety Is Important Belmont </h2>
<p>This decreased load center is specified, recognizing that loads may be handled which have a higher density and, therefore, shorter load center than the truck rating.

Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
