<h3>The History Of The Hand Pallet Truck Park Ridge IL 60068</h3>
<p>Raymond 4000 Series sit down forklifts provide the visibility needed to maximize operator confidence, and minimize damage to racks, products, and facilities. It's the grandchild of the C5000 series, one of the most beloved forklifts ever made. Not all forklifts work the same, and many come equipped with different features. These forklifts can drive under 8 foot passages, and come in two-wheel, four-wheel, and four-wheel crab steering (all wheels are able to turn).</p>

It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
