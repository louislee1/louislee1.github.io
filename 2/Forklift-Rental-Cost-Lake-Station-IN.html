It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Unlike other online shops, our customer support representatives are actual mechanics who are seasoned in fitting, installing, and maintaining truck and SUV air suspension. For instance, if a heavy load brings the center of gravity all the way to the front axle — the theoretical edge of the stability triangle — sudden braking could shift the load forward and out of the triangle altogether.</p>
