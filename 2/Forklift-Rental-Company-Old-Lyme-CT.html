It has a certain vibe about it that says, I'm here, I'm big, and you should probably get out of my way.” Whether you're going for a little lift to help you gauge more rugged terrain, or a megalift for that monster truck street cred, a lifted truck involves a lot of considerations.</p>
<p>This alone should be reason enough to ensure your operators are properly trained where safety and health regulations are involved. New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance.

<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
