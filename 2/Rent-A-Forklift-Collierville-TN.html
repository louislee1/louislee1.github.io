As the name suggests, the reach forklift is primarily designed to pick up loads high in racking or storage.</p>
<p>Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Choose a jack pallet scale from METTLER TOLEDO that will withstand regularly heavy industrial use. The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops. If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be. However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
