Choose from corrosion-resistant pallet jacks for demanding environments, or all-terrain jacks for navigating various types of ground surfaces.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads.
