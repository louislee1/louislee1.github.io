The nine-model P-Series RT forklift range includes units with rated lift capacities from 5,000 to 30,000 pounds (24-inch load center), with two-, three-, and four-section mast configurations. Single-double forks - forks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side.</p>
