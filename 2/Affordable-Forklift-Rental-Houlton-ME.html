<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.

Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
