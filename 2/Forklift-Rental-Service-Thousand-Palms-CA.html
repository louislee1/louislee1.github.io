<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard. But for serious off-road enthusiasts, getting a truck lifted or buying an existing lifted truck should certainly be a consideration at least.

Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck.
