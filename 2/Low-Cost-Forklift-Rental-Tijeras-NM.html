But if you drive on a sloped surface, your center of gravity could pass outside of the stability triangle and the lift could tip.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>
<h2>Pallet Truck Images, Stock Photos & Vectors Tijeras </h2>
<p>If you do most of your work indoors it is unlikely that you'll ever need one, but rough terrain forklifts are a must for outdoor applications and construction sites. Note: Service calls are not officially logged until you hear back from an Eastern Lift Truck Co. employee. It is suggested that powered industrial trucks be painted a color which will comply with the USA Standard Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards and the Identification of Certain Equipment, Z53.1-1967.</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these wonderful machines or perhaps hoping to diversify your fleet, here are the seven different categories of forklifts and a breakdown of what they are used for. Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>

<p>Report pallet jacks with a failing hydraulic unit. Our guide covers the most popular forklift types and the best uses for each, so you can make a well-informed, confident decision on which is the best forklift for your specific warehouse and its needs. All employees who work in the area should be familiar with the unique hazards associated with pallet jacks and the safe work practices expected in the workplace.</p>
<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse. Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>

If you own your own machinery, our team of qualified mechanics will ensure that your material handling equipment is reliable and in safe working order.</p>
<p>On the basis of end use, the global Pallet Trucks market can be segmented into food & beverage, retail stores, wholesale distribution, freight & logistics and manufacturing and others.

Most warehouse forklift types can carry 5,000 lbs, though heavy-duty models can manage even heavier loads.</p>

<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling. We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>

Forklifts are one of the most expensive pieces of machinery on a jobsite. These pallet trucks are designed to carry heavy loads with minimum effort.
