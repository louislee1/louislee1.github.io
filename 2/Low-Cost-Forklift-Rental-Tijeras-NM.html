<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

<p>If you do most of your work indoors it is unlikely that you'll ever need one, but rough terrain forklifts are a must for outdoor applications and construction sites.

Our guide covers the most popular forklift types and the best uses for each, so you can make a well-informed, confident decision on which is the best forklift for your specific warehouse and its needs. All employees who work in the area should be familiar with the unique hazards associated with pallet jacks and the safe work practices expected in the workplace.</p>
<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse.
