<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. In the United States, approximately one person is killed in a forklift accident every 3 days on average. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else.

With a solid schedule of consistent and high-quality maintenance, your forklift can be relied upon to provide years of worry-free performance. Regardless of the order picker or forklift job, one thing is for certain: if your employees drive order picker trucks, they need an order picker license.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>
