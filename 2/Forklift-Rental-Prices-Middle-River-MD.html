In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles.

<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. Lift Capacity: 2000 lbs. For trucks with tilting masts the mast shall be vertical or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. We asked the experts and were referred to the Cal OSHA General Industry Safety Order 3656 for Order Pickers and Stocker Pickers for the answers.
