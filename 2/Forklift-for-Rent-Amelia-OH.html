Body Lift Kit: If you're interested in getting more off-road capabilities but are still on a somewhat limited budget, go the middle ground with a body lift kit, which includes adding spacers between the body and frame to give you more space for off-road tires.</p>
<p>Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing.

Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
