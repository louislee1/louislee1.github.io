<p>Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond Certified Technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility.

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
