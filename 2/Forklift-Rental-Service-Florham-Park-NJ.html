For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers.

Within minutes, you can place an order and have a fleet of forklifts on the way. These types of forklifts are ideal for just about every kind of work inside warehouses and distribution centers.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
