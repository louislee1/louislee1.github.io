It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes.

<h3>Travelling Heavy Loads Using Diesel Forklifts Alliance NE 69301</h3>
<p>A standard warehouse forklift measures between four and seven feet wide and eight to ten feet long. We're the best place to compare second-hand forklifts from the likes of Mitsubishi, Linde, Kamatsu, Nissan and Caterpillar - names that are trusted by companies operating across the world. Both of these stackers have the ability to lift to heights commonly found on forklifts.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
