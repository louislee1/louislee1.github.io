An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>

<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>The operator has to be aware of the forces bearing on the forklift as it turns corners. Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.
