<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. In the United States, approximately one person is killed in a forklift accident every 3 days on average. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else. Class 4 forklift, primarily used indoors on smooth surfaces, commonly warehouse operations transporting 2,000 - 90,000lbs. Just knowing the challenges associated with a lifted vehicle can help you increase safety in and around your truck.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse.
